## Day 0: September 6th, 2018
I pledge to study machine learning for a minimum of one hour daily for the next 100 days, share my progress on social media, and encourage at least one other member of the challenge takers on their journey.

**Today's Progress:**
1. Set up Github repo for the challenge blog
2. Watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s
3. Began watching videos in [Machine_Learning_Journey](https://github.com/llSourcell/Machine_Learning_Journey)

**Today's Tasks:**
	
- [x] Completed One hour of Machine Learning Study
- [x] Shared my progress on social media using #100DaysofMLCode
- [x] Encouraged at least one other person taking the challenge by liking, retweeting or commenting on thier post


**Thoughts:**
After completing the Microsoft Professional Program for AI and receiving a certificate, I feel the need to learn and do more in the field. This challenge is a way to begin to socialize and share my passion of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
